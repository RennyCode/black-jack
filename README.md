## Game Rules:
In Black Jack there is a player and a dealer, the goal of the game is to win over the hand of the dealer with your own cards, the individual with closer cards count to 21 and not over it is the winner of each round.
A round begins with each player getting 2 cards from the deck that are shown to all, the dealer gets 2 cards but reveals one of them.
In the count system any royalty card is considers a '10' and an ace could be '1' or '11'.
In turns the player and the dealer can choose between 'hit' action whcil will add a card to their set and 'stand' which will stop the player from doing any actions and the current set of cards are the final set for the comperison.
Any cards count the goes over 21 is an automatic lose.
The split action can be taken by the player in case of getting a copy of the last card (value wise), then the player gets to continue the game with two sets of card when he need only of off them to win over the dealer to win the round.
The dealer acts last and must darw until he has a count of at least '16'.
